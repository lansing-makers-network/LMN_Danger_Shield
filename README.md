# LMN_Danger_Shield
This is an customized version of the depricated Sparkfun Danger Shield v17

Changes.
* added foot prints for optional pull-ups to buttons. I have run across several UNO's who's internal pull-ups do not work.
* Added 3 pin header for Servo, driven by PWM on D9, which is in parallel to Cap Sense.
* added USB1881 Hall effect sensor, in parallel to TMP36. As TMP36 is out of stock at SFE.
